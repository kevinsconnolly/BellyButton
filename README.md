# BellyButton


For the BellyButton module, our goal to create an interactive data visualization websbite was used in conjunction with Plotly.jp, which is a Javascript data visualization package. The challege goals are the following:
  1) Use javascript to create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in each volunteer's navel.
  2) Complete the demographic info guide
  3) Create the bubble chart vizualization
  
The Resources used for the challenge are data sources of index.html, plots.js and samples.json.  We also used VS Code, Web Browser, Github and Gitbash.
  
At the end of the Challenge and code, I was able to create unify all pieces of code, experience and patience to create an interactive and enhance key pieces of data with unique, visualizations.
